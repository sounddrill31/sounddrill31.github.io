      <description>This project aims to port Super Mario 64 to the PlayStation 2, after it was decompiled.&#xA;For a while, it refused to work on recent sdk versions on real hardware, despite improving performance.&#xA;Made a few tweaks as suggested by @metchebe and @xdccrlz here and maintained it for a while. Also made a helper script to package it into an iso for easy OpenPS2Loader use!&#xA;The upstream repo seems to have fixed this issue, but when I tried it, my save got wiped :(</description>
