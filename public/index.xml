      <description>OpenDroid Wiki: Building android is very complex, needing a lot of expertise, calmness of mind, and a non-insignificant understanding of how these devices function.&#xA;I contributed to early documentation(especially helping with Crave.io related documentation) and maintain a good chunk of this at the time of writing.&#xA;Website&#xA;My Content Contributions&#xA;Content Source for Documentation</description>

      <description>OpenSUSE&amp;rsquo;s repos didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have floorp browser so I made a repo that checks github releases regularly and repackages them for OBS. It&amp;rsquo;s very rough around the edges but it works great even tho I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it in months.&#xA;Repository&#xA;Source Code</description>

      <description>I have made a few useful github actions workflows to make my life easier and to help people:&#xA;Crave AOSP Builder: Build Full Android ROMs - With Github Actions(Powered by Crave.io)&#xA;Android is usually very big - 250 to 450GB worth of source code, needs 64GB of memory for seamless compilation, etc.&#xA;While not everyone has those resources, Crave.io provides build systems to improve this, allowing anyone to learn android building.</description>

      <description>This project aims to port Super Mario 64 to the PlayStation 2, after it was decompiled.&#xA;For a while, it refused to work on recent sdk versions on real hardware, despite improving performance.&#xA;Made a few tweaks as suggested by @metchebe and @xdccrlz here and maintained it for a while. Also made a helper script to package it into an iso for easy OpenPS2Loader use!&#xA;The upstream repo seems to have fixed this issue, but when I tried it, my save got wiped :(</description>
