## Online Presence:
I have positively contributed to these large and small communities in a meaningful way:
* Crave.io: Helped with community tools, answering questions, creating documentation, etc. I maintain a bridge from there to ROM Builders telegram using matterbridge.
* NIOS Students: Created an unofficial discord server for helping students get information and assist them with the process. Also worked on recent helper website.
* XDA: Briefly helped out new users with unbricking devices and installing custom aftermarket flavors of android, even reaching "Legendary" role which is measured based on community interactions and automatically granted by a helper bot. Also granted the "Trusted" role by the moderation team based on meaningful activity around development channels. 
* Otaku Discord: Helped moderate and overhaul [TheInternationalOtaku](https://www.twitch.tv/theinternationalotaku)'s discord and met many cool people there.
* Xonotic India: Created "The Server Bay" discord server with proper game chat bridges(MelanoBot and MatterBridge) for gathering Indian OSS Gaming Enthusiasts together.
