I have created, contributed to and participated in many small projects. Here are some projects I'm proud of:

### *Crave AOSP Builder*: 

Build Full Android ROMs - With Github Actions(Powered by Crave.io)

Android is usually very big - 250 to 450GB worth of source code, needs 64GB of memory for seamless compilation, etc. 

While not everyone has those resources, [Crave.io](https://crave.io) provides build systems to improve this, allowing anyone to learn android building. 

Here, I have made a github actions workflow to interface with crave - without any need for touching the terminal!

### *OpenDroid Wiki*:

Building android is very complex, needing a lot of expertise, calmness of mind, and a non-insignificant understanding of how these devices function. 

I contributed to early documentation(especially helping with Crave.io related documentation) and maintain a good chunk of this at the time of writing.

### *SM64-PS2*: 

This project aims to port Super Mario 64 to the PlayStation 2, after it was decompiled. 

For a while, it refused to work on recent sdk versions on real hardware, despite improving performance. 

Made a few tweaks as suggested by @metchebe and @xdccrlz [here](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/sm64-port/issues/72#issuecomment-1265325542) and maintained it for a while. Also made a helper script to package it into an iso for easy OpenPS2Loader use!

The upstream repo seems to have fixed this issue, but when I tried it, my save got wiped :(   Still, I got pretty far in and enjoyed the game quite a bit!

### *Checkpost-Arduino*:

A simple arduino checkpost project, for a friend. Original code is from @SimpleCircuits, where I reposted and relicensed with permission. 

I fixed up the code and helped out with setting it up

### *Turbo C++ Web*: 

Turbo C++ is quite widely used in the academic side in India, for some weird reason. I used JS-DOS's [Bundle Creation tool](https://dos.zone/studio/) and packaged @AvinashReddy3108's [TurboCPP4Linux](TurboCPP4Linux) with it to make a simple web wrapper for it

This is only a proof of concept and it's not very usable because quotes don't work on firefox/edge
